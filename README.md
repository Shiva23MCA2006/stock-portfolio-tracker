To create a virtual environment and install Flask and Requests in it, follow these steps:

Create a folder where you want the project to be:

Right-click on your desired location and create a new folder (for example, tracker).
Open Command Prompt (CMD) in that folder:

Navigate to the folder where you created the folder.
In the address bar of File Explorer, type cmd and press Enter. This will open the Command Prompt in that folder.
Create a virtual environment:

In the Command Prompt, run the following command:
python -m venv tracker
Activate the virtual environment:

After the virtual environment is created, activate it using the following command:
tracker\Scripts\activate
Install Flask:

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask by running:
pip install flask
Install Requests:

Similarly, install the Requests library by running:
pip install requests
Now your virtual environment is set up with Flask and Requests installed.
