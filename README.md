To create a virtual environment and install Flask and Requests in it, follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder** where you want the project to be:
   - Right-click on your desired location and create a new folder (for example, `tracker`).

2. **Open Command Prompt (CMD)** in that folder:
   - Navigate to the folder where you created the folder.
   - In the address bar of File Explorer, type `cmd` and press Enter. This will open the Command Prompt in that folder.

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   - In the Command Prompt, run the following command:
     ```bash
     python -m venv tracker
     ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - After the virtual environment is created, activate it using the following command:
     ```bash
     tracker\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install Flask**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, install Flask by running:
     ```bash
     pip install flask
     ```

6. **Install Requests**:
   - Similarly, install the Requests library by running:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

Now your virtual environment is set up with Flask and Requests installed.
